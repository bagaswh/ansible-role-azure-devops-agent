# Azure DevOps Agent

An Ansible role that installs and configures a Linux machine to be used as an [Azure DevOps build or deployment agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux?view=vsts).

See [this blog post](https://medium.com/gsoft-tech/easily-configuring-an-azure-devops-agent-with-ansible-fb9cb0f98b73) for more detail.

## Requirements

[See prerequisites](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/blob/master/docs/start/envlinux.md)

- **az_devops_accountname**

  The name of your Azure DevOps account, i.e. ttps://dev.azure.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME

- **az_devops_accesstoken**

  The Personal Access Token (PAT) used to authenticate to your account. [See here for details on how to generate this value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux?view=vsts#authenticate-with-a-personal-access-token-pat).

  _Note: Think about using Ansible Vault to secure this value._

- **az_devops_project_name**

  The name of the Azure DevOps project in which to register the agent (only used for deployment groups).

- **az_devops_agent_version**

  Version of the installed agent package. Should be periodically updated to the latest version (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-linux?view=vsts#download-and-configure-the-agent))

- **az_devops_agent_user**

  Use either `build`, `deployment` or `resource`. Build role allows the use of the agent as a build server in pipeline build or releases. Deployment role allows the use of the agent in a deployment group. Resource role allows the use of the agent as a virtual machine resource that can be targeted by deployments from a pipeline and belongs to an environment.

- **az_devops_deployment_group_tags**

- **az_devops_reconfigure_agent**

  Forces a reconfiguration of the agent even if the service is already active

- **az_devops_agent_user_capabilties**

  A Dictionary of environment variables to set for the agent process which translate to User Capabilties which can be helpful for setting [release pipeline demands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/demands?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: agents
      roles:
         - yohanb.azure_devops_agent
      vars:
        - az_devops_agent_role: build
        - az_devops_accountname: fubar
        - az_devops_accesstoken: ***
